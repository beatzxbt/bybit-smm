        Refreshes the trades data with new data.

        This method should be implemented by subclasses to process

        ----------
        recv : Union[Dict, List]
            The received payload containing the trades data.

        Steps
        -----
        1. Extract the list of trades from the recv payload.
           -> Ensure the following data points are present:
                - Timestamp
                - Side
                - Price
                - Size
        2. Overwrite the self.format array with the correct values and call 'self.trades.append(self.format.copy())'.
           -> Remember to call this for each trade in your list.

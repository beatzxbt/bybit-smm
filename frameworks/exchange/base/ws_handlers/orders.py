        Initializes the OrdersHandler class with an orders dictionary.

        Parameters
        ----------
        orders : dict

        Refreshes the orders data with new data.

        This method should be implemented by subclasses to process

        Parameters
        ----------
        recv : Union[Dict, List]
            The received payload containing the orders data.

        Steps
        -----
        1. Extract the orders from the recv payload. Ensure *at least* the following data points are present:
            - orderId or clientOrderId
            - side
            - price
            - size

        2. For each order:

        Parameters
        ----------
        recv : Dict
            The received payload containing the orders data.

           a. Create an Order() instance with the respective values. 
           b. self.orders[orderId or clientOrderId] = Order()

        3. If any orders need to be deleted:
